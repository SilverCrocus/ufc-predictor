# UFC Predictor - Optimal Betting Strategy Framework

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive betting strategy framework is designed to maximize profitability from the UFC prediction system's 72.9% accuracy rate while managing risk through systematic bankroll management, market timing, and multi-market optimization. The strategy exploits documented market inefficiencies in UFC betting while maintaining sustainable long-term edge.

## 1. Bankroll Management Framework

### 1.1 Kelly Criterion Implementation

**Base Kelly Calculation:**
```
Kelly Fraction = (bp - q) / b
where:
b = decimal odds - 1
p = model probability
q = 1 - p
```

**Risk-Adjusted Kelly Tiers:**

**Tier 1 - Conservative (Default):**
- Kelly Multiplier: 0.25 (Fractional Kelly)
- Maximum Single Bet: 5% of bankroll
- Minimum Expected Value: 8%
- Use Case: Standard UFC winner bets

**Tier 2 - Moderate:**
- Kelly Multiplier: 0.5 (Half Kelly)
- Maximum Single Bet: 7.5% of bankroll
- Minimum Expected Value: 12%
- Use Case: High-confidence style matchup advantages

**Tier 3 - Aggressive:**
- Kelly Multiplier: 0.75
- Maximum Single Bet: 10% of bankroll
- Minimum Expected Value: 15%
- Use Case: Severe market mispricing (rare opportunities)

**Portfolio-Level Constraints:**
- Maximum total exposure per event: 25% of bankroll
- Maximum correlated exposure (same card): 15% of bankroll
- Minimum bankroll reserve: 20% (never bet below 80% allocation)

### 1.2 Drawdown Protection

**Dynamic Bet Reduction:**
- 10% bankroll loss: Reduce all bet sizes by 25%
- 20% bankroll loss: Reduce all bet sizes by 50%
- 30% bankroll loss: Pause betting, reassess model accuracy

**Recovery Protocol:**
- Return to full sizing only after bankroll recovers to within 5% of previous high
- Implement minimum 10-bet winning streak before tier upgrades

## 2. Market Timing Strategy

### 2.1 Line Movement Exploitation

**Opening Line Strategy (48-72 hours before event):**
- Target: Underdogs with model probability >40% at odds >+150
- Rationale: Early lines often inflated by name recognition
- Action: Place 60% of intended stake on opening lines

**Closing Line Strategy (2-6 hours before event):**
- Target: Favorites where model shows >65% win probability
- Rationale: Sharp money moves favorites closer to true odds
- Action: Place remaining 40% of stake near event start

**Line Movement Triggers:**
- Fade public: Bet against line movement >10% driven by ticket count (not money)
- Follow sharp money: Bet with line movement supported by high-limit wagers
- Reverse line movement: Strong opportunity when lines move against public betting

### 2.2 Public Bias Fade Strategy

**Systematic Fade Conditions:**
- Popular fighter receiving >70% of bets but line moving against them
- Fighters with recent highlight-reel finishes (recency bias)
- Fighters returning from long layoffs (nostalgia premium)
- Aging legends in decline (reputation lag)

**Contrarian Betting Targets:**
- Technical fighters vs flashy strikers (public prefers excitement)
- Grapplers vs strikers (casual fans undervalue grappling)
- Shorter fighters vs taller opponents (height bias)

## 3. Bet Selection Criteria

### 3.1 Expected Value Thresholds

**Winner Bets:**
- Minimum EV: 8% (Conservative Tier)
- Preferred EV: 12%+ (Higher allocation)
- Elite EV: 20%+ (Maximum allocation)

**Method Bets (using method prediction model):**
- Minimum EV: 15% (higher uncertainty requires higher premium)
- KO/TKO specialists vs chinny opponents: 20%+ EV required
- Submission specialists vs poor ground game: 18%+ EV required

**Prop Bets:**
- Round totals: 12%+ EV (moderate uncertainty)
- Performance props: 15%+ EV (high variance)

### 3.2 Style Matchup Integration

**High-Confidence Scenarios (Increase bet size by 25%):**
- Elite wrestler vs poor takedown defense (<60% TDD)
- Heavy hands vs poor chin (>3 KO losses in last 5 fights)
- Cardio advantage vs known gas tank issues
- Southpaw vs orthodox with <50% southpaw experience

**Low-Confidence Scenarios (Reduce bet size by 50%):**
- Similar skill levels across all metrics
- Both fighters coming off long layoffs
- Significant weight class changes
- First UFC fights (limited data)

### 3.3 Weight Cutting Indicators

**Red Flags (Avoid or bet against):**
- Missed weight in last 2 cuts
- Visible struggle at weigh-ins
- Same-day weight cut >10% of fight weight
- Fighter looking drawn/depleted at ceremonial weigh-ins

**Green Flags (Increase confidence):**
- Professional nutritionist/cutting team
- History of easy weight cuts
- Fighting at natural weight class
- Good hydration/recovery protocols

## 4. Multi-Market Optimization

### 4.1 Single vs Multi-Bet Allocation

**Portfolio Allocation:**
- Single Bets: 70% of betting bankroll
  - Winner bets: 50%
  - Method bets: 15%
  - Prop bets: 5%
- Multi-Bets: 30% of betting bankroll
  - 2-leg parlays: 20%
  - 3-leg parlays: 8%
  - 4+ leg parlays: 2% (lottery tickets only)

### 4.2 Correlation Assessment

**Same-Event Correlation Penalty:**
- 2 fighters from same card: 8% EV reduction
- Fights from same weight division: Additional 5% reduction
- Main card vs preliminary correlation: 3% reduction

**Multi-Bet Construction Rules:**
- Maximum 2 fights from same event in parlays
- Prefer mixing weight classes and fight styles
- Include at least one favorite and one underdog per multi-bet
- Avoid betting related props (e.g., both method and round total)

### 4.3 Cross-Sportsbook Arbitrage

**Arbitrage Identification:**
- Monitor 3+ sportsbooks for line discrepancies >5%
- Target guaranteed profit opportunities >2%
- Account for sportsbook limits and restrictions
- Maximum arbitrage allocation: 10% of bankroll per opportunity

**Preferred Sportsbooks for Line Shopping:**
1. TAB Australia (current integration)
2. Sportsbet
3. Ladbrokes
4. Pointsbet
5. Unibet
