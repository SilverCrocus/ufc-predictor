# UFC Bet Tracking System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive bet tracking system that seamlessly integrates with your existing UFC betting notebook. The system automatically logs betting recommendations, tracks performance, and provides easy result updating after fights.

## Files Created

### 1. Core Tracking Module: `/Users/diyagamah/Documents/ufc-predictor/src/bet_tracking.py`

**Comprehensive bet tracking system with:**
- CSV-based data storage with 23 columns covering all betting details
- Automatic bet ID generation (format: `BET_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_uuid`)
- Risk level calculation based on EV and bankroll percentage
- Performance analysis and reporting
- Data validation and automatic backups
- Excel export functionality

**Key Classes:**
- `BetRecord`: Dataclass for individual bet records
- `BetTracker`: Main tracking and analysis class

**Key Functions:**
- `log_bet_from_opportunity()`: Log bets from notebook recommendations
- `update_fight_result()`: Update individual bet results
- `update_event_results()`: Bulk update entire events
- `generate_performance_report()`: Comprehensive performance analysis

### 2. Notebook Integration Cells

**Added to your notebook:**
- **Bet Tracking Integration Cell**: Automatically extracts recommendations from `profitability_results`, `backup_results`, or `final_recommendations` and logs them to CSV
- **Result Update Helpers Cell**: Simple functions to update bet results after fights

### 3. Helper Files

**Additional utility files:**
- `notebook_integration_cell.py`: Standalone version of the integration cell
- `result_update_helpers.py`: Standalone result update functions
- `notebook_bet_tracking_integration.py`: Alternative integration approach

## How to Use

### 1. Automatic Bet Logging (Run after profitability analysis)

The integration cell in your notebook will automatically:
1. Find betting recommendations from your analysis
2. Log them to CSV with all relevant details
3. Apply bankroll safety limits (max 10% per bet)
4. Generate unique bet IDs for tracking
5. Display execution plan with total stakes and expected profits

### 2. Result Updates (Run after fights)

**Single Bet Update:**
```python
update_single_bet('BET_20250726_143022_abc12345', 'WIN')
```

**Event Bulk Update:**
```python
update_event_results_simple('UFC Fight Night - Whittaker vs de Ridder', {
    'Robert Whittaker': 'WIN',
    'Petr Yan': 'LOSS',
    'Sharaputdin Magomedov': 'WIN'
})
```

### 3. Performance Analysis

```python
# Show pending bets
show_pending_bets()

# Performance summary
show_performance_summary()

# Full detailed report
tracker = BetTracker()
tracker.generate_performance_report(days=30)
```
