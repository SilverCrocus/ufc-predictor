## System Architecture

### 1. Data Structure
```
Training Data: model/ufc_fight_dataset_with_diffs.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 21,448 historical fights (1993-2024)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fighter stats and differential features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO betting odds (not needed for training)

Test Data: data/test_set_odds/test_set_with_odds_20250819.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1,901 unique fights (Dec 2021 - Aug 2025)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Each fight appears twice (both perspectives)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REAL betting odds from historical scraping
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Average odds: 2.43x
```

### 2. Key Commands

| Command | Purpose | What It Shows |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `./ufc train` | Train models with optimization | Model accuracy metrics |
| `./ufc validate` | Test pure prediction accuracy | Win/loss accuracy (no odds) |
| `./ufc backtest` | Calculate ROI with real odds | Betting returns, bankroll growth |
| `./ufc predict` | Predict single fight | Winner probability |

## Walk-Forward Backtest System

### How It Works
The walk-forward backtest (`proper_roi_backtest.py`) simulates real betting conditions:

1. **Initial Training**: Train on all fights before Oct 2021
2. **Walk Forward**: Move through time in 3-month windows
3. **Periodic Retraining**: Retrain model every 6 months
4. **Bet Simulation**: Place $20 bets when confidence > 60%
5. **Real Odds**: Use actual historical betting odds

### Implementation Details
```python
# Key parameters
Initial bankroll: $1,000
Bet size: $20 fixed
Confidence threshold: 60%
Retrain frequency: 6 months
Test window: 3 months
Model accuracy: 73.5%
```

## Understanding the Metrics

### ROI vs Bankroll Growth - THE KEY DISTINCTION

Many people get confused by this, so let's be crystal clear:

#### ROI on Stakes (e.g., 67%)
- **Formula**: Profit √∑ Total Amount Bet
- **Example**: $20,000 profit √∑ $30,000 total staked = 67%
- **What it measures**: Betting efficiency
- **Industry standard**: How professionals measure edge

#### Bankroll Growth (e.g., 2,000%)
- **Formula**: (Final - Initial) √∑ Initial
- **Example**: ($21,000 - $1,000) √∑ $1,000 = 2,000%
- **What it measures**: Actual money multiplication
- **What you care about**: How much your money grew

### Why They're Different
```
You start with $1,000
You make 1,500 bets of $20 each = $30,000 total staked
BUT you're REUSING your bankroll!

Bet 1: $1,000 - $20 + winnings
Bet 2: New balance - $20 + winnings
...continues...
Final: $21,000

You never had $30,000! You recycled your $1,000 bankroll 30 times.
```

## Backtest Output Explained

### Period Results
```
Period 1: 2021-12-04 to 2022-03-04
   Fights: 101
   Period ROI: +52.8%
   Period ending bankroll: $1,855
```
Shows performance for each 3-month window.

### Final Summary
```
üìä Betting Statistics:
   Total bets placed: 1,500      # How many bets over entire period
   Wins: 1,050 (70%)             # Win rate
   Total amount staked: $30,000   # Sum of all bets (recycled money)
   Net profit: $20,000            # Actual profit

üí∞ Performance Metrics:
   ROI on stakes: 67%             # Profit/Total staked
   Starting bankroll: $1,000      # What you started with
   Final bankroll: $21,000        # What you ended with
   Bankroll growth: 2,000%        # How much your money grew
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Why is my ROI 67% but my bankroll grew 2,000%?
**A:** You're recycling your bankroll! You bet $30,000 total but only ever had $1,000. The 67% ROI is on total stakes, while 2,000% is your actual money growth.

### Q: What's the difference between training and test data?
**A:** Training data (21,448 fights) teaches the model who wins. Test data (1,901 fights) has real betting odds for ROI calculation.

### Q: Why don't we need odds for training?
**A:** The model only needs to learn who wins/loses. Odds are only needed to calculate betting returns.

### Q: What does walk-forward mean?
**A:** Instead of training once, we retrain every 6 months as we move through time, simulating real betting where you'd update your model periodically.

### Q: How accurate is the 73.5% win rate?
**A:** This is from walk-forward validation on the test set. It's realistic because the model never sees future data when making predictions.

---

## Troubleshooting

### NaN Values in Output
- **Cause**: Some fights missing odds data
- **Solution**: Already fixed - code skips fights with invalid odds

### Confusing ROI Numbers
- **Remember**: ROI on stakes ‚â† Bankroll growth
- **Focus on**: Final bankroll and growth percentage

### Model Not Found
- **Run**: `./ufc train` first to create models
- **Check**: `model/optimized/` directory for model files

---

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Retraining**: Run `./ufc train` monthly with new data
2. **Live Betting**: Use `./ufc predict` for upcoming fights
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track actual vs predicted results
4. **Adjust Confidence**: Modify 60% threshold if needed

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is for educational purposes**. Real betting involves risk.

‚úÖ **The system shows strong historical performance** but past results don't guarantee future returns.

üéØ **Your edge comes from**:
- High model accuracy (73.5%)
- Favorable average odds (2.43x)
- Disciplined betting ($20 fixed)
- Confidence threshold (60%)
