## Overview

This document describes the production-ready sophisticated multi-bet UFC betting system that implements conditional parlay logic, advanced correlation estimation, probability adjustments, conservative staking, and comprehensive portfolio management.

## Architecture

## Mathematical Formulations

### 1. Correlation-Adjusted Probabilities

The system uses a **Gaussian Copula approach** with enhanced correlation penalty:

```
P_adjusted = P_independent × (1 - α × ρ̄ × β)

Where:
- P_independent = ∏(p_i) for individual probabilities  
- ρ̄ = weighted average pairwise correlation
- α = correlation penalty factor (1.0-1.5, default: 1.2)
- β = legs adjustment factor: √(n-1)/n
```

### 2. Multi-Source Correlation Estimation

Blends four correlation sources with configurable weights:

```
ρ_final = w₁×ρ_same_event + w₂×ρ_feature_similarity + w₃×ρ_residual_historical + w₄×ρ_heuristic

Default weights: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
```

#### Correlation Sources:

**a) Same-Event Correlation**
- Base correlation: 0.15 for same-card fights
- Position proximity bonus: +0.05 for adjacent fights
- Event type adjustments: +0.02 for PPV events

**b) Feature Similarity Correlation**
- Cosine similarity of normalized feature vectors
- Weighted by feature importance
- Maximum correlation: 0.20

**c) Historical Residual Correlation**
- Empirical correlation from historical prediction errors
- Fighter archetype classification (striker/grappler/balanced)
- Minimum 50 samples required

**d) Heuristic Correlation**
- Weight class proximity: +0.03 same division
- Betting line correlation: +0.04 for dual favorites
- Training camp: +0.08 for same camp

### 3. Pessimistic Kelly for Parlays

Uses 20th percentile probability with additional penalties:

```
Kelly_parlay = [(p₂₀ × odds_combined - 1) / (odds_combined - 1)] × 0.5 × (1 - ρ̄ × 0.2)

Where:
- p₂₀ = 20th percentile of probability distribution
- 0.5 = pessimistic Kelly fraction for parlays
- Correlation adjustment reduces stake further
```

## Algorithm Design

### Conditional Parlay Logic

```python
def analyze_betting_opportunities(bet_legs):
    qualified_singles = identify_qualified_singles(bet_legs)
    
    if len(qualified_singles) >= single_bet_threshold:
        # Sufficient single bets - focus on singles
        return {'single_bets': qualified_singles, 'parlays': []}
    else:
        # Insufficient singles - activate parlay system  
        remaining_legs = exclude_used_legs(bet_legs, qualified_singles)
        parlays = generate_optimal_parlays(remaining_legs)
        return {'single_bets': qualified_singles, 'parlays': parlays}
```

### Optimal Parlay Selection

1. **Generate Combinations**: All 2-leg and 3-leg combinations from available legs
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Build correlation matrix for each combination
3. **Probability Adjustment**: Apply correlation penalty to combined probability
4. **EV Filtering**: Require minimum 10% expected value
5. **Risk Scoring**: Calculate multi-dimensional risk score
6. **Kelly Sizing**: Apply pessimistic Kelly with portfolio constraints
7. **Ranking**: Sort by risk-adjusted expected value

## Feature Engineering Requirements

### Required Features for Correlation Analysis

**Fighter Physical Attributes:**
- Height, reach, age, weight
- Stance (orthodox/southpaw)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Striking accuracy, takedown accuracy
- Submission attempts per fight
- Significant strikes per minute
- Takedown defense percentage

**Historical Performance:**
- Win streak, recent performance trend
- Activity level (fights per year)
- Experience (total fights)

**Context Features:**
- Training camp/team affiliation
- Weight division
- Card position
- Event type and venue

### Feature Preprocessing

```python
# Normalize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
numerical_features = scaler.fit_transform(raw_features)

# Weight features by importance
weighted_features = numerical_features * feature_weights

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarity = 1 - cosine_distance(fighter1_features, fighter2_features)
correlation_estimate = similarity * 0.20  # Scale to max 20%
```

## Statistical Validation

### Backtesting Framework

**Walk-Forward Validation:**
- 252-day training windows
- Weekly rebalancing
- Out-of-sample testing

**Performance Metrics:**
- ROI, Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio
- Maximum drawdown, VaR (95%, 99%)
- Win rates by bet type
- Correlation validation tests

**Statistical Tests:**
- Probability calibration (Brier score)
- Correlation prediction accuracy
- Kelly criterion validation

### Calibration Testing

```python
# Bin predicted probabilities
bins = np.linspace(0, 1, 10)
for bin_lower, bin_upper in zip(bins[:-1], bins[1:]):
    in_bin = (predicted_probs > bin_lower) & (predicted_probs <= bin_upper)
    if in_bin.sum() > 0:
        predicted_rate = predicted_probs[in_bin].mean()
        actual_rate = outcomes[in_bin].mean()
        calibration_error = abs(predicted_rate - actual_rate)
```

## Risk Metrics and Portfolio Management

### Position Sizing Constraints

**Single Bets:**
- Maximum 5% of bankroll per bet
- Minimum 5% edge required
- Pessimistic Kelly with 25% fraction

**Parlays:**
- Maximum 0.5% of bankroll per parlay
- Maximum 2 parlays active
- Total parlay exposure capped at 1.5% of bankroll
- Minimum 10% edge required

### Risk Monitoring

**Exposure Limits:**
```python
max_total_exposure = 10%  # Total portfolio exposure
max_parlay_exposure = 1.5%  # Total parlay exposure  
max_single_bet = 5%  # Individual bet size
correlation_threshold = 0.25  # Maximum allowed correlation
```

**Real-Time Alerts:**
- High correlation detected (>0.25)
- Excessive exposure (>8% total)
- Low diversification (risk score >0.7)
- Model calibration drift

### Portfolio Optimization

Uses mean-variance optimization with correlation adjustments:

```python
def optimize_portfolio(opportunities, correlation_matrix):
    # Objective: Maximize Sharpe ratio
    sharpe = expected_return / sqrt(portfolio_variance)
    
    # Constraints:
    # 1. Total weight = 1
    # 2. Individual weights <= max_position_size
    # 3. Total exposure <= max_exposure
    
    return optimized_weights
```

## Production Implementation
